## Introduction
What you're expecting is some kind of step-by-step tutorial for an OpenLDAP server but I won't do that. The main reason we are here is to learn what is an OpenLDAP server and how to create our own lab to work on.

The things we are going to do here:
- A virtual router
- A DHCP server
- A DNS server
- An OpenLDAP server

Everything We are going to do will be hosted on Ubuntu server 24.04. You can do this on another distro if you want but I did this before on this distro so I'm comfortable with it.
Requirements:
- A machine to deploy every server
- 1 Client

If you want to create the VMs on VirtualBox, you can go for it (I'm going to show how to do it on this program). You can use Proxmox or VMware if It fits you the most, but take in account that proxmox will need and entire pc with decent specifications.

## Virtual Router
First of all I'm going to explain why we are doing this. Well, we could just use our own router but to be more flexible and just to make it a bit harder we are going to crete our own router to route traffic. Why? Because we can control everything: firewall, traffic, routing tables...

After the explanation, before installing the distro we have to give our router two network adapters:
1. Bridged
2. Internal red (the name is up to you, I'm going to leave it on default)

After that we got to install everything. I'm not going to show everything about the installation process so I'm going to show you the configuration of the network and leave the rest up to you.

My configuration is this one (remember to change every adapter to manual, because DHCP is on by default):

For enp0s3 (the bridged adapter):
      
      --> Subnet: 192.168.0.0/21
  
      --> Address: 192.168.1.100
  
      --> Gateway: 192.168.1.1
  
      --> Name servers: 8.8.8.8, 8.8.4.4

For enp0s8 (the internal adapter):
      
      --> Subnet: 10.0.0.0/24
  
      --> Address: 10.0.0.1
  
      --> Gateway: 192.168.1.100
  
      --> Name servers: 8.8.8.8, 8.8.4.4
