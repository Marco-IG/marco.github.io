## Introduction to myself

Hello everyone reading my blog!  

I'm creating this blog for you to follow my journey toward becoming a DevOps (or maybe a SysOps), since my dream is to develop advanced skills in system administration, networking, and coding.  

Since I'm just starting out and still working on my ASIR certification, I’ll begin by sharing tutorials—more like detailed explanations—about interesting projects you can do in Linux, Windows, Python, or anything else that comes to mind.  

I hope you enjoy this blog! The very first project I'm going to tackle is a Linux OpenLDAP server. I’ll also set up a DHCP and DNS server so I can create a good combination and teach you different concepts, rather than just doing a step-by-step instruction activity.
